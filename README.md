# LabelConnector
Connect Nodes via label-matching. Super light-weight without callbacks.

Usage:

**F9** - created new Connector Dot using a selected Dot (or any other node, then it creates new Dot). Alternatively, it will rename an existing selected Connector Dot alongside all dependend Nodes.

**F8** - connects all label matches when mutliple nodes selected, not showing the Connector UI. Alternatively creates new connection with single empty labeled node selected, showing the Connector UI. With no selection, it will create a new PostageStamp/NoOp showing the Connector UI.
 
**ctrl+F8** - when a single alrady labeled node is selected, this will force to make a new connection instead of connecting the existing label match.

Feel free to color your Connector Dots, these colors will then appear in the Connector UI.
