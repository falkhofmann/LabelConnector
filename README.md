# LabelConnector
Connect Nodes via label-matching. Super light-weight without callbacks.

Usage:

**F9** - created new Connector Dot using a selected Dot or other node and then creates new Dot, or renames a selected Connector Dot alongside all connected Nodes.

**F8** - connects all label matches when mutliple nodes selected. Creates new connection with single node selected. With no selection, it will create a new PostageStamp/NoOp.
 
**ctrl+F8** - when a single node is selected, this will force to make a new connection instead of connecting the existing label match.

You can also color your Connector Dots as these colors will then appear in the Connector UI.
